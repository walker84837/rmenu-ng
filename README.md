# rmenu-ng

Rewrite of [rmenu](https://github.com/SuperCuber/rmenu) as a configurable app using [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) and [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

## Motivation

I find myself seeing rofi everywhere, and I prefer having an "independent" one, written in Rust.

# Examples
Examples can be found in the `examples` folder.
You can probably understand how to use the library even without being a Rust guru if you read the documentation.

# License

Original was WTFPL, since it doesn't talk about any other license I will probably choose
